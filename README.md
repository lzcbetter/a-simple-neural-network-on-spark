# a simple neural network on apache spark

A simple implementation of artificial neural network based on Apache Spark and python. this is another implementation of my toy program  https://github.com/lzcbetter/step-by-step-neural-network

detailed comments about this ANN model please refer https://github.com/lzcbetter/step-by-step-neural-network

todo:

1. add comments about the implementaion

2. well abstract as a class and make the model more general
